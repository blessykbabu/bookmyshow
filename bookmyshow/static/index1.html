      <p>2018 (also known as 2018: Everyone is a Hero) is a 2023 Indian Malayalam-language survival drama film based on the severe 2018 Kerala floods that devastated Kerala. It is directed by Jude Anthany Joseph, who wrote the screenplay with Akhil P. Dharmajan, and stars Tovino Thomas, Kunchacko Boban, Asif Ali, Vineeth Sreenivasan, Narain and Lal with an ensemble supporting cast.

        The film was announced on 16 October 2018 by Jude Anthany Joseph. Principal photography commenced on 27 May 2022. The film was shot in different parts of Kerala, as well as Tirunelveli and Hyderabad. The filming was wrapped up on 13 November 2022. Overall, despite a sluggish opening hour, "2018" effectively recreates the floods that devastated Kerala in 2018 and showcases the people who became heroes by helping one another. The film has several emotional moments and is technically accomplished. It's well worth watching.</p>
